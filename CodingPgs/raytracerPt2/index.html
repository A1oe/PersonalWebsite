    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this assignment, I added 2 new features to the pathtracing project: Microfacet Model (allows for glossy surfaces)
        and Depth of Field via Focal Depth and Aperture. The Microfacet Model was implemented through NDF (Normal Distribution
        Function), Fresnel Term, as well as using importance sampling. The Depth of Field was implemented through simulating a thin lens 
        by generating 2 rays that simulate a ray that has refracted.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Model</h2>
    <p>We can see below that as the alpha decreases, the metallic quality of the dragon's material increases. At the smallest
            alpha, the dragon is almost completely matte yellow. However, as the alpha increases, the dragon's coloring includes 
            its surroundings (blue, black, red) as well.</p>

    <p> Settings: -t 8 -s 128 -l 1 -m 5 -r 480 360 </p>

        <p> Note: Little white specs, also known as fireflies, occur because a 
            super specular surface (as with higher alphas) in a ray's path cause radiance to increase. </p>

        <p> Below, we can see images of CBbunny rendered with the implemented importance sampling and the given cosine
            hemisphere sampling. We can see a black outline around the cosine hemisphere sampling
            bunny, as well as more noise on the image. The reason is because the importance sampling 
            converges faster than the ccosine hemisphere sampling. The cosine hemisphere sampling bunny needs a different alpha.</p>

    <p>
        The difference between a pinhole camera and a thin-lens camera model is that the pinhole camera is the ideal camera,
        able to focus on everything in the image. On the other hand, the thin-lens camera is more similar an eye in that
        it focuses on one area of the image.

    <h3>Focal Depth</h3>
        <p> Note: I was unable to get the program to build locally, 
            so all the images in this report were rendered in the hive machines.
            Therefore the pictures for focal depth are harder to understand what is going on.</p>

        <p> Changing the focal depth is supposed to allow the camera to focus on specific parts of an image. However,
            it's hard to see here because I was unable to move the camera closer to the bunny, to capture the changes in
            focus when focusing on the head vs tail.</p>

            light on and around the bunny, specifically with the bottom light blob on the hind leg of the bunny.</p>
