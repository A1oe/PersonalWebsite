        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a rasterizer that can draw traingles in different colors and textures.
            In addition, there are multiple ways that have been implemented to avoid aliasing: bilinear and nearest samplings
            of both pixels and levels of mipmap and supersampling of 1, 4, 9, and 16 samples per pixel.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

        <p>
            I rasterize triangles by first finding the norm (pointing to the third point)
            of each line created by each pair of points. Then, I go through each pixel in a square
            created by the maximum and minimum X and Y of the three coordinates. I create a vector
            using the midpoint of each pixel and one of the three pixels.

            I take the dot product of each normal and the vector. If the result of any dot product is less than 0,
            I don't rasterize that pixel because it is not in the triangle.
        </p>

        <p>
            My algorithm is no worse than the one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle
            because the algorithm is doing exactly that.
        </p>

    <div align="center">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/test4.png" align="middle" width="600" />
                    <figcaption align="center">test4's result. There is some aliasing with this method of rasterizing triangles.</figcaption>

    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
    <p>
        My supersampling algorithm consists of splitting each pixel into sub pixels and sampling each sub pixel.
        Then, in the resolve_to_framebuffer() function, I determine the color of the actual pixel based on the average
        of the sub pixels that make up the pixel. To do this, I simply increased the size of sample_buffer to save the sub pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
        Supersampling is useful to better determine the appropriate color of a pixel to avoid jaggies. I modified the resolve_to_framebuffer()
        function to turn the sample_buffer vector (which has more pixels) into the original (fewer pixeled) picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used supersampling to antalias my triangles by taking the average of the supersamples in every pixel to color the pixel,
        so that the colors of the pixels represent the image better.
    </p>

                    <figcaption align="middle">Rate = 4</figcaption>

                <td>
                    <img src="images/test4_rate16.png" align="middle" width="600px" />

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>
        We can see above that as the rate increases, the quality of the triangles increases as well.
        Clearly, the jaggies disappear. The reason for this is because As the number of samples per pixel increases,
        each pixel has more possible colors to average. Thus, it's increasingly possible to account for colors
        that lower sampled images wouldn't.

            Barycentric coordinates is a system such that any point can
            be defined as a combination of the coordinates. In the image above,
            we can see how the colors have shifted from the tip of the triangle to
            the side, creating a gradient effect. We can extend this to how barycentric
            coordinates can be used in other ways as well.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>
        Pixel sampling is sampling at a coordinate for a pixel.
        I used it to perform texture mapping by taking a coordinate from a texture and sampling from there.
        Nearest pixel sampling is taking the nearest integer coordinate to sample from.
        Bilinear pixel sampling is taking the linear interpolation of the 4 nearest integer coordinates
        and using the result as our sample.

                    <img src="images/part5_bilinear_1.png" align="middle" width="600px" />

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <p>
        We can see that at the samplings at 16 per pixel are fairly similar. However, we can clearly
        see the difference between nearest and bilinear sampling with the pictures at 1 sample per pixel.
        The bilinear sampling makes colors generally similar, whereas nearest sampling can result in pixels with colors
        with different values than the ones around it.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of this is with the much lighter pixel in the "Nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel"
        photo. This same pixel in "Bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel" is a lot darker and blends in with the pixels
        around it. So, we can see that there will be large difference when there are a lot of color value shifts
        next to each other in the same photo, in combination with low rates of samples per pixel.
    </p>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>
        Level sampling is taking different level quality of images to allow the user to
        determine which level would be appropriate for the image. I implemented it for texture mapping
        by using barycentric coordinates to determine which level would be appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Super-Sampling: The more we super-sample, the more "accurate" the pixel's color will become.
        However, the tradeoff is that it will be a lot slower and memory inefficient,
        since each pixel will have to be sampled more times and the sample must be saved.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pixel Sampling: In comparison, pixel sampling does not give us as "accurate" a pixel color, 
        since we are linearly interpolating (or using the nearest integer sample) to estimate the color. 
        However, it is slighty faster and much more memory efficent, since we only sample once per pixel. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Level Sampling: Level sampling is less memory efficient and slower than pixel sampling, but more memory efficient and faster than super-sampling.
        It uses 4/3 times more memory than pixel sampling to save the different levels of mipmap.
